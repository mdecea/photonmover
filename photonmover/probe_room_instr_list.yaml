# Describes the instruments present in the setup.
# This should be constructed as a list, where each element of the list is
# a dictionary describing a specific instrument
# Each dictionary should at least have two keys:
  # - "class_name", that indicates the class to be instantiated;
  # - "class_package", which indicates the package to contains the class definition
# Optionally, if the constructor requires parameters an additional key "class_params" (which is another
# dictionary where each key is a parameter for the constructor).

Setup:
  smu_mode: 'meas_cur'
  rec_splitter_ratio: 0.1  # The received power is the 10 % tap of a 90:10 splitter after the output fiber.

      use_as_laser: True  # If we only want to use it as a power meter, set this to False (when we are using another laser)
